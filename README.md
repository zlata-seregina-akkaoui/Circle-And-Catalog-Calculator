# Circle-And-Catalog-Calculator
This repository contains two Python programs. Part 1 calculates the circumference of a circle using the formula \( C = 2\pi r \). Part 2 calculates item and combo prices, applying discounts. Both use functions, variables, and arithmetic operations to organize and display results. See the code for details.
